# Simple-Shader
This was my final project for a Computer Graphics class at San Jose State University, taught by professor Kevin Smith. I wrote the shader to feature anti-aliasing, reflections, and area lights. The shader can render spheres, planes, and boxes (composed of triangles in this example). The project was written with openframeworks, using c++.
To compile:
1. Create a new openframeworks project
2. Drag all files in this repository into their respective folders in the openframeworks
3. If you're using visual studio, make sure the project files get updated (to do this manually you can just drag the src files into the src folder in the solution explorer)
4. Build and run
